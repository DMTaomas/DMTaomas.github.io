                    <p>He was also known as “the Bard of Bengal”. Tagore’s monument can be seen in St. Stephens’s Green.

On his third trip to Britain Tagore had originally shown his work to a painter named William Rothenstein. Rothenstein became too overwhelmed and passed them on to William Butler Yeat. Tagore was highly impressed and from there Yeats began to spread his literature across the area only in London.</p>

As we learned, Ireland was broken down into four provinces. The four Provinces of Ireland: Connaut (Connaught), Leinster, Munster, and Ulster were permanently set by the English administration of James I. The four provinces of Ireland no longer serve administrative or political purposes but function as historical and cultural entities.</p>

                    <p>(25 September 1819 – 22 January 1904) was a distinguished and influential Irish mathematician and Anglican theologian. After working in algebraic geometry for two decades, Salmon devoted the last forty years of his life to theology. His entire career was spent at Trinity College Dublin. Trinity college is one of the most elite and prestigious colleges around Europe and is one of the most historical in town. It was impossible to do a project on the culture of Ireland without getting some of the key figures that changed the educational program for Europe.</p>

                    <p>O’Connell Bridge is one the most important bridges in Ireland and it represents a key passageway that splits Dublin into two sides completely. Originally known as the Carlisle bridge and designed by James Gandon, this bridge played an iconic role in linking the southern and northern parts of Ireland. Architecturally, it displays fine workmanship in the ashlar stonework and cast-iron lamp standards. It makes a significant contribution to the cityscape and is of considerable social importance as the heart of the city of Dublin and the key bridge over the Liffey.</p>
