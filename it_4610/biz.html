                    <p>The image above is a representation of the famous Arthur Guinness signing a lease for the St. James's Gate Brewery, Dublin. He leased the brewery for 9000 years at an annual rent of £45. The brewery was only 4 acres in size, disused, and had little brewing equipment. This Guinness barrel represents one of the many barrels around Dublin showing respect to Arthur and his brewery craft. Due to Guinness, now being distributed worldwide, Ireland is known for this specific type of brew and this small town man turned this into a million dollar corporation.</p>
