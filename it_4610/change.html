This fountain is the gift of the people of the German Federal Republic to indicate their gratitude for Ireland’s help after World War II. Ireland did not joing this war but it did declare neutrality.

                    <p>Croppy’s Stone is located on Croppy’s Acre, a public park near downtown Dublin that is supposedly the location of a mass grave for Irish revolutionaries. The “Croppy” name comes from the nickname for the cropped haircut of the rioters. Long subject to British colonial rule, Irish history is littered with battles against oppression. This stone is a monument to those who lost their lives in the 1798 uprising.  </p>

This sign represents the historical changes that Ireland went through and many of the key figures discussed in our project would not be of importance if it was not for the Irish gaining their own independence. This proclamation can be found as a symbol of the work put in by the Provisional Government Thomas J. Clarke and his associates. </p>
