                <h3>A Reflection</h3>
                <p id="first">Growing up, I never had a moment that clicked, “I know what I want to do for the rest of my life!”. High school consisted of mostly going through the motions, assuming I’d go to college, and it would come to me. Often I don’t think I give myself enough credit – I worked throughout high school, and nothing really was handed to me. However, through all that, seeds were sown as for what drives and gives me passion in life today. </p>

                <p>Originally in high school, I was enthralled with the Bernie Sanders campaign. It seemed to me as the fastest and most efficient way to help fellow human beings, and improve the human race. However, as time has passed, I’ve soured on national American politics as a primary way to make material improvements in people’s lives. To me, direct local action makes the most sense to do that. </p>
                
                <p>It was at about this time that I moved away from political campaigns that majoring in Information Technology began to make more sense. Political science classes were a struggle for me due to their theoretical nature. IT felt more real and was less anxiety inducing when thinking about the general employment conditions after graduation. However, just focusing on solving the puzzle of an IT issue without looking at the bigger picture of life isn’t fulfilling in the long run. </p>

                <p>So, have I found an answer to my initial question growing up? Sure, I have found passions, things I enjoy doing, software I enjoy using. As for a job title I’m pining for? That has yet to materialize. I think in our rapidly changing world, hoping for a specific job to grab and hold for fifty years is naïve. What I would like to do is find something that makes a material difference in people’s lives, while using the competencies learned in school to live in our digital world. 
                    Whether that looks like creating a website for a local organization or creating content for an issue I believe in, as long as I’m doing something that incorporates both I’m feeling good. </p>
