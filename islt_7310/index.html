        <p>The purpose of this page is to create a professional portfolio for myself. As I’m nearing the end of my 
            (formal) educational career, I’ll need tools to market myself to potential employers. This website will act 
            as a portal for said employers to look through my achievements and get an idea of who I am. Initially, 
            the website will introduce users with an introductory page. Then, they will get an introduction to who I 
            am; Details about my degree, place of education, and some other personal information. After the 
            introductory pages, we’ll go into a projects/experiences page. Finally, an overarching goals/philosophy 
            page will tie everything together, connecting my past learning experiences to how I will use them in 
            future settings. A contact page with personal information will be present at the end.  </p>
