        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>Hello! My name is <em>Thomas Semkiw</em>, I'm a student at the <strong>University of Missouri</strong> in my final year. I was born in Michigan, but have been living in Columbia for 14 years or so. 
            Originally, I was in school for political science, but after a gap semester about three years ago I changed to studying IT.<br><br> So far, I've enjoyed Database and VR development classes the most, but am excited about this front-end development class! I've done some front end work in the past for school and other personal projects.
            I'd like to be more comfortable in using/customizing CSS by the end of the class. Particularly, I'd like to gain skills at making websites more user friendly, and getting better at making sites that work on both web and mobile. In my free time, you might find me shooting pool at <em>Billiards on Broadway</em>, or enjoying the great outdoors by hiking or playing disc golf.</p>
